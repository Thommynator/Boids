# Boids
This Unity project simulates the behavior of a swarm. 
The coplex looking behavior is achieved by pretty simple rules, which every Boid follows.
The rules are:
* Don't get too close too your neighbors
* Adapt the speed and direction of your neighbors
* Slightly converge into the center
* Stay inside the boundaries
* Avoid predators

All rules can be dynamically weighted and toggled, while the simulation is running.
